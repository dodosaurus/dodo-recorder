- [ ] fix bug then sometimes it is not rendered (it probably depends on initially loaded parent HTML, for ex. youtube.com is problematic)
- [ ] make recording widget nicer - add more options there - think about what is needed, what for ex. Playwright Codegen has and we do not
- [ ] after some change is made, Electron app running in dev mode, pops on top of all windows in my MacOS - maybe some live change watch is enabled and app is reloaded and jumps on top? I want live reload, but app should not pops on top of all my MacOS env

- [x] add assertion mode where elements will on hover will be highlighted like with Playwright Codgene/dev tools insepcting elements - or we can have a mode that will be by default off, but we can turn that "inspection" mode on (it resembles also inspect from chrome dev tools)
- [x] add more options for output format - user could configure what he wants to include
- [x] add some panel in browser for assertion mode/taking screenshot, so we are not dependent on hotkeys (similar to Playwright Codegen)
- [x] when writing in input a lot of events are recorded
- [x] check if our doc is in sync with what project looks like
- [x] refactor the transcript in transcript.txt table - still assumes maybe it is also somewhere else in project, that on assertion we are doing screenshot automatically, but we do not do that, we need to remove all mentions of that from everywhere 
- [x] do not clean user preferences (URL and path) after I save recording
- [x] add option to clear current recording and start over
- [x] screenshot taking needs new hotkey, F9 does not work on MacOS (changed to Cmd+Shift+S / Ctrl+Shift+S)
- [x] cleaning up session output and only including actions.json and transcript of commentary (enhanced commentary) with ids; adapt docs with new changes
- [x] clean up whisper node compeltely from the project, find references; make sure our direct approach is always full replacement for whisper-node we used in the beginning
- [x] defaulting saving sessions to some folder/caching from previous selection; URL and path should be cached
- [x] fix voice recording and transcription - does not work yet
- [x] add new logo, some nice icon
